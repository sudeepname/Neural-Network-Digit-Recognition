# Neural-Network-Digit-Recognition
This is my First step towards deep learning and in this repository i have used regular neural network to reach up to 96.5% accuracy in recognition of the digits from the image
here i have used 2 layerd regular neural network and also used faltten to send the feature point in sequence to the neural network
